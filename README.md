# Project Name: HSE Shieldify
### Team Name: Mavericks
### Problem Statement
[Detection & Alerting an unsafe HSE situation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JL83Mrlztwiv4s6VATMp27o6GqRSqRJe/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110520318584563461489&rtpof=true&sd=true)


### Project Flow:
"The functionality of 'HSE Shieldify' follows a streamlined flow, ensuring both safety compliance and ease of use:
1. **Employee Verification:**
- An employee logs into the kiosk system and positions themselves in front of a camera.
- The system verifies if the employee is wearing the required personal protective equipment (PPE).
- If the verification is successful, the kiosk confirms with a 'verified' tick, allowing the employee to proceed. If the employee is not wearing the required PPE, they can retry the process.
2. **Alert System:**
- After several unsuccessful attempts, the system automatically alerts the manager via email or SMS, notifying them of the missing PPE. Simultaneously, logs are generated for further review.
- The kiosk system sends frames of images to the ML model, which analyzes them and returns a JSON response indicating the presence or absence of PPE components (e.g., Helmet: true, Gloves: false).
3. **Dashboard & Monitoring:**
- The dashboard displays statistics and logs generated by the model's analysis, alongside employee information.
- The manager can customize PPE detection requirements based on the specific needs of different departments through the dashboard website.
- Additionally, the manager can integrate CCTV camera feeds into the system, allowing them to monitor live footage. They also have the option to test video frames against the model to ensure PPE compliance.
